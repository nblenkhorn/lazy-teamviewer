# lazy-teamviewer

Let's face it, I'm lazy. These are command line scripts for macos to run on a remote computer via SSH. The script will wake the remote machine, log you in, and then launch TeamViewer and upload a screenshot of the login information to Dropbox. When you are done, the other script will close TeamViewer and log out your remote machine.

This way I can log into my iMac via TeamViewer from my laptop without having to get up and walk across the room :)

## queue-teamviewer
* Change the username and password information.
* Adjust the x,y,w,h for the screen capture to suit your screen

## cleanup-teamviewer
* Close and log out
